### üìä Strategies Included

| # | Strategy             | Description                                                                              |
| - | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Long Call**        | Buy a call option to profit from rising prices. Loss is limited to premium paid.         |
| 2 | **Long Put**         | Buy a put option to profit from falling prices. Loss limited to premium.                 |
| 3 | **Bull Call Spread** | Buy a lower strike call, sell a higher one. Limited risk, limited reward.                |
| 4 | **Bear Put Spread**  | Buy a higher strike put, sell a lower one. Used when expecting a drop.                   |
| 5 | **Long Straddle**    | Buy both a call and put at the same strike. Profits from big moves either way.           |
| 6 | **Long Strangle**    | Similar to a straddle, but with out-of-the-money options. Cheaper but needs bigger move. |
| 7 | **Iron Condor**      | Sell a put spread and call spread. Profits if stock stays in a range.                    |
| 8 | **Protective Put**   | Own the stock + buy a put as insurance. Limits downside risk.                            |
